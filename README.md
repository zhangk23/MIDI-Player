# MIDI-Player

This demo aims to create sound and visual synchronization based on keyboard MIDI information. The piece chosen for this demo is La Campanella ("The little bell"), a piano etude composed by Franz Liszt in 1851 based on the theme from first movement of Niccolo Paganini's Violin Concerto No.2 in B minor.

The following framework files are provided by Professor Soji Yamakawa (Carnegie Mellon University):
- fssimplewindowcpp.cpp
- fssimplewindow.h
- fssimplewindowobjc.m
- yssimplesound.cpp
- yssimplesound.h
- two yssimplesound OS specific scripts

The two input data files include:
- lacamp.txt: a text file contains processed MIDI information of all the notes in the piece selected.
- lacamp.wav: a wav file of music generated from the same MIDI file as the previous text file. 
(The original MIDI file is under Creative Common License and is not included because some pre-processinng was already done to convert from MIDI to text file.)

Instructions:
- No user interaction involved once the demo starts running.
- Press ESC to quit the demo anytime.
